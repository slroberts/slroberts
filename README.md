### My name is Shomari Roberts, a Front-end Engineer from New York City excited about developing functional websites and web applications with Javascript using React and Next.js.

My journey into web development began as a UI designer, where I witnessed the transformation of my designs into functional websites. This sparked my interest and drove me to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I quickly realized my love for web development and further honed my skills by attending the Full-stack Web Development Bootcamp program at Bloom Institute of Technology (formerly Lambda School).

During the Bootcamp, I embraced industry-standard coding practices, including Git workflow, and gained valuable experience building numerous projects with JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, Express, and SQL.

Since completing the Bootcamp, I have been actively expanding my front-end skills. I have added Next.js, Gatsby, and TypeScript to my toolkit, allowing me to deliver even more robust and performant web experiences.

I am passionate about creating elegant and user-friendly interfaces, combining my design background with my technical skills. I am excited to collaborate on innovative projects and contribute to the success of web development initiatives.
