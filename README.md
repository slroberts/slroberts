### My name is Shomari Roberts, a Front-end Engineer from New York City excited about developing functional websites and web applications with Javascript using React and Next.js.

My background as a UI designer greatly piqued my interest in web development. I saw how the websites I designed were made functional. With that spark, I started to learn and build websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to test the waters of web development, and I liked it even more! After that, I immersed myself in Bloom Institute of Technology's (FKA Lambda School) Full-stack Web Development Bootcamp program to craft my skills. While attending the Bootcamp, I utilized industry coding practices such as Git workflow, while I gained meaningful experience building many projects with JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, Express, and SQL.

Since I completed the Bootcamp, I have been working towards enhancing my front-end skills by adding Next.js, Gatsby and TypeScript to my toolset.
