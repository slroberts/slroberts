### :wave: Hello there! My name is Shomari Roberts.
I am a Full Stack Developer from New York City, excited about developing pixel perfect, functional front-end applications. My background in UI design combined with my experience in web development deepens my perspective and understanding for both mediums, respectively. The focus on front-end development facilitates my ability to produce user-centered solutions. I have experience working with JavaScript, React, Redux, Gatsby, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and SQL.
